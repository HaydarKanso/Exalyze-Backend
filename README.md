# Exalyze-Backend
Exalyze-Backend is the server-side component of the Exalyze web application. It is built with Spring Boot and provides RESTful APIs for data analysis, file uploads (Excel/XLSX), authentication (sign-up/sign-in), and dynamic chart generation. The backend handles business logic, data processing, and serves the frontend with structured JSON responses.
